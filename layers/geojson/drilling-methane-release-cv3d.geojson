Pockets of natural gas, which is 95-98% methane, are often found along with oil and simply burned off in a very visible process called “flaring.” But scientists are starting to realize that far more methane is being released by the fracking boom than previously thought. <br><br> Earlier this year, Cornell environmental engineering professor Anthony Ingraffea released the results of <a title=\"http://www.pnas.org/content/111/30/10955\" href=\"http://www.pnas.org/content/111/30/10955\" target=\"_blank\">a study of 41,000 oil and gas wells </a>that were drilled in Pennsylvania between 2000 and 2012, and found newer wells using fracking and horizontal drilling methods were far more likely to be responsible for fugitive emissions of methane. <br><br> According to the <span class=\"caps\">NASA</span> researchers, the region of the American Southwest over which the 2,500-square-mile methane cloud is floating emitted 590,000 metric tons of methane every year between 2002 and 2012—almost 3.5 times the widely used estimates in the European Union’s <a title=\"http://edgar.jrc.ec.europa.eu/\" href=\"http://edgar.jrc.ec.europa.eu/\" target=\"_blank\">Emissions Database for Global Atmospheric Research</a>—and none of it was from fracking. <br><br> That should prompt a hard look at the entire fossil fuel sector, not just fracking, according to University of Michigan Professor Eric Kort, the lead researcher on the study: <blockquote>“While fracking has become a focal point in conversations about methane emissions, it certainly appears from this and other studies that in the <span class=\"caps\">US</span>, fossil fuel extraction activities across the board likely emit higher than inventory estimates.”</blockquote> <a href=\"http://climateviewer.com/2014/10/22/nasa-confirms-a-2500-square-mile-methane-clloud-floating-over-us-southwest/\">http://climateviewer.com/2014/10/22/nasa-confirms-a-2500-square-mile-methane-clloud-floating-over-us-southwest/</a><p class=\"p1\">San Juan Generating Station, located about 15 miles northwest of Farmington, N.M., is operated by PNM and consists of four coal-fired, pressurized units that generate about 1,800 gross megawatts of electricity to serve PNM's customer base and that of eight other owners.
